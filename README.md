# Odin
## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the work done to learn web development skills through the Odin Project (TOP). TOP is a "open-source community" in which they deliver a free curriculum on the skills required to become a full-stack developer. The curriculum is setup in such a way that as one incrementally learn skills, smaller projects are assigned to solidify them into a skill-set, which, as a whole, is tested at the end of overarching units with larger projects.
